## Help
To make Jaser more easy to use, it has a built in multi language system that allows it to translate its interface to another language. If a language you know is not supported, you can add it by going to the ```app/strings.json``` file and adding to each of the objects within the `strings` array object a property name of the language's language code and a value of the word translation. A list of language codes is available at: [https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/locales/](https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/locales/)
